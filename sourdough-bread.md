## Sourdough bread

This website would not be complete without the recipe for plain sourdough bread. This is the bread I make most often, about once a week. It has everything I
like in bread: a soft airy crumb with the tangy flavour typical of sourdough, and crunchy golden crust.

There are some tweaks you can make to the base recipe; I'll list them at the end of the page.

### Ingredients

For 1 large loaf:
- 800 gr strong white flour; my favourite here is French T55 flour, a flour of medium strength that gives the bread a particularly soft crumb.
- 550 gr water (70%)
- 280 gr sourdough starter (35%); can be lowered to 250 gr if preferred.
- 16 gr salt (2%)

### Procedure

Refer to the [basic guide](...) page, specifically the "Preparing the dough" section, for information on how I mix and knead dough by hand.

At 6:30 PM, I prepare the ingredients and knead the dough until the gluten has developed. At 7:00 PM I am usually finished. I spread a bit of vegetable
oil around the bottom and sides of a bowl using a paper towel, then sprinkle a bit of flour. I then transfer the dough to this bowl, cover it with a kitchen towel
(or two if it's a particular cold day) and leave it in a warm place to ferment.

The **fermentation** time is about 4 hours at room temperature. I often do 3-4 sets of [coil folds](...) every 30 minutes at the beginning, then leave the dough
to ferment undisturbed for the remainder of the time. Folds are not necessary for a good result, but I find that they make the shaping part a bit easier as the
dough tends to stick less.

At 11:00 PM, I shape and prepare the dough for proofing. I transfer the dough back to a floured kneading board; then I take each of the four "corners" of the dough,
lift it up and close it toward the center of the dough. I turn it upside down, so this closed part is on the bottom, and then I "drag" the dough several
times with my hands until I get a very smooth surface. The purpose is to get a tensed-up ball, with lots of surface tension, which will help the dough rise and
open up in the oven during the baking process. This procedure is hard if the dough sticks to your hands too much, as you will not be able to tense it up; take
care to always have a bit of flour on your hands, or on particularly sticky sides of the dough. Use a bench scraper to help yourself in keeping the dough
in shape if needed.

Now for the proofing; take a bowl or loaf pan, place a cotton kitchen towel and flour its surface generously. Add the dough on the towel, with the surface on
the bottom, then close the towel on the dough and transfer it to the fridge.

It is of course possible to proof the dough at room temperature, in which case it will take about 1.5-2 hours. However I find that a long proofing in the
fridge makes for a better result. This is because the surface of the dough will dehydrate a bit, and it will be much easier to handle the dough when
transferring it to the oven and scoring it, as it will not stick to the towel as much. Moreover long leavening times in the fridge tend to make for stronger,
more complex flavours as the yeasts have more time to slowly digest the compounds in the dough.

Fun fact: I actually came up with "fridge proofed bread" by accident. I wanted to bring fresh bread to a lunch with friends, but all the recipes I knew at the time
were meant to have bread ready at the very earliest in the early afternoon; this included those recipes that do a cold fridge fermentation. After a while I
thought about retarding the proofing stage instead; I was worried the time in the fridge would be too long (8-9 hours in fridge compared to 1.5-2 hours at
room temperature), but instead it turned out even better than usual, and now I always use this.

### Baking

The morning after (8-9AM): take the dough out of the fridge and preheat the oven to 240 degrees static mode. Use whatever method you want to steam the oven; I
use a Pyrex casserole dish with a lid. It works using the same principle as a Dutch oven, but it's way cheaper, and you can use it to make casseroles or stews
as well. The size of this loaf is actually calibrated on the size of my Pyrex dish, so if you are using the same method you might need to perform adjustments.

I put the dish in the oven while it is heating. Once the oven reaches the temperature, I take the dish out and I transfer the dough on the lid. I peel off
the towel (if you floured it well, it should peel off without sticking), score the surface of the dough using a sharp razor, close the dish on top of the lid
nicely and place it in the oven. After 20 minutes, the dough should have risen nicely. The sealed environment provided by the Pyrex dish traps the steam coming
off the bread inside, allowing for a nice rise. Now, turn down the oven to 205-210 degrees, remove only the dish from the oven (leaving the exposed bread
on its lid) and bake for a further 30 minutes. The long time here - longer than you would think by just looking at the bread! - is necessary to make a crust
that is deep enough to be crunchy, and stay crunchy even after a few days. A thin crust is not only less pleasant to the bite, but will also get soft and
gummy. Don't worry, it will not burn.

Remove the bread from the oven; as soon as possible, try to move it to an oven grill or other rack so the bottom part will dry out properly. Let it cool down
for at least 1 hour before slicing. If you want to store it in a bread bin or in the freezer, wait at least 3-4 hours until it is completely cooled down, or
it will form unpleasant condensation and get soggy. If you plan to store some of it in the freezer, I recommend to slice it in advance; this bread gets tougher
to slice as it goes stale (and even when frozen fresh it will go a bit stale) and the risk of your knife slipping over the hard crust and causing injuries gets
larger. You can defrost it at room temperature; passing it in the oven for a few minutes or in the toaster will restore some of its freshness.

### Common tweaks

#### Partial wholewheat flour

Possibly my favourite tweak. I use 250 gr of extra-coarse stoneground wholewheat flour and 550 gr strong white flour. With this tweak I often need a slightly
longer fermentation time, around 5 hours. Wholewheat flour does tend to make bread more dense, with a weaker oven rise,
however I find that this flour proportion strikes the best balance: you get the enhanced flavour of a wholewheat flour, but an airiness and softness that is very
close to plain white bread.

#### Other types of flour

I've tried 100% white or brown spelt flour, or 100% durum wheat semolina.

White spelt flour was a bit underwhelming: I did not find it that different to any regular strong white flour. Brown spelt flour has instead a much richer flavour;
you can either use 100% brown spelt flour, or the same proportions as I explained in the "Partial wholewheat" section above. In both cases keep in mind that
spelt has a lower gluten content than wheat, therefore fermentation times might need to be adjusted upward even more. For 100% brown spelt flour, 6-7 hours
were necessary.

Durum wheat semolina is a very refined bright-yellow flour made from durum wheat. It behaves very similar to white wheat flour, but the final bread will have
a pleasant yellow tinge (both in the crumb and in the crust) and a somewhat different flavour profile. If you use 100% of this flour, you will have replicated
Altamura bread, a specialty bread made in one specific region of Italy.

#### Room temperature proofing

If you prefer your bread ready for dinner, rather than lunch, you can of course proof at room temperature for 1.5-2 hours, then bake straight away. Here you
need to be careful not to over-proof the bread, otherwise it will get even stickier than it usually is, and it risks collapsing in the oven rather than
getting a beautiful rise. Look online for **the finger test**, which gives you a way to judge when the bread is ready to bake.

If you start in the morning (say, around 9-10AM) this bread should be ready to be sliced by dinner time.

#### Higher hydrations

I've tried hydration levels of 75%, with and without autolyse; this is supposed to get an even airer crumb, but so far the results have been exactly the same
as the plain bread I've described here. More experiments will follow :)

#### Cold fermentation

I've tried cold fermentation by reducing the sourdough starter proportion to 12%; the fermentation stage then became 2-3 hours at room temperature, followed
by 36-48 hours in the fridge and finally 2 more hours at room temperature to de-chill. The proofing stage remained the same; I've used room temperature
proofing this time. However the resulting flavour was not significantly better to justify all the extra time, and I have not experimented with
cold fermentations since.

### Preparing and kneading the dough

I knead all dough by hand. It's part of the fun for me! Here's how to make the experience more pleasant.

In any sourdough recipe, the order in which you add ingredients is not important. The only exception is salt: do not add salt directly to the starter or
you risk killing the bacteria. Therefore, the order in which I add ingredients is always the same no matter what the recipe says, and is dictated primarily
by convenience.

- First, I add all the liquids (water or milk) to the bowl with my refreshed starter. I stir with a spoon until the starter has partially dissolved.
   - I usually refresh the exact amount of starter I will need for a given recipe, so I reuse the same bowl and cut down on washing.
- Then, I add approximately half the flour and stir it in until I get a very thick and clumpy batter.
- Then, if the recipe calls for it, I add any of the following: eggs, sweeteners (sugar, honey, ...), salt, yogurt, oils, flavourings such as vanilla extract or fruit zest.
  Basically any ingredient that is either dry (except flour) or semi-liquid. This is because the dough is thick enough to allow for good combination of
  ingredients without ruining the starter, but still liquid enough that I can mix everything in with a spoon with just a few good stirs.
- Then, I add the remainder of the flour. At some point the spoon will no longer be able to stir it, and I will move it to the board and start kneading by hand.
- Butter goes now; I generally do not melt it and cool down. I leave it at room temperature for a few hours so it gets very soft, and then work it in the dough
piece by piece.
- Any topping (nuts, raisins, pieces of cheese, etc...) also goes now, working it a bit to mix it with an already stiff dough.

Then, start kneading; you will need between 10 minutes for a simple bread dough, and 40-50 minutes for very enriched or very hydrated doughs. I generally use
the palms of my hand, pushing the dough forward, then grabbing it and slamming it back. I use a scraper to move it around to knead different parts of it. If
you need a break, don't worry; bread dough also likes to rest for a few minutes. Wash your hands and return to work.

What is happening now? The constant movement is redistributing the liquids and flour around. The gluten in the flour is arranging itself into a microscopic
reticule structure that holds the whole thing together strongly. This is why flour with a high gluten content is called strong flour after all. The yeast will
be somewhere in the vicinity too. As the bacteria eats, the gas produced as a byproduct will remain trapped within the cells of the reticule, encased in
the gluten structure, and form the pockets of airs that makes bread soft.

It is important to note two things that influence the structure:

- presence of wholewheat flour. Wholewheat flour has less refined and heavier grains; it will be harder for the dough to form large air bubbles as the weight of
  the wholewheat grains will break them after a certain size.
- presence of fat (butter, eggs, milk, oils ...). Fat molecules are also larger and heavier than plain wheat, achieving the same effect. On the other hand, fat
  will make the dough softer just by being there.

At a macroscopic level of course you cannot see this, but you should feel the dough changing under your hands; it will start very sticky, shaggy and with
pieces falling off the sides. At the end it should be very elastic, smooth, slightly sticky but not too much, as the water has been "absorbed" in the reticule.
If unsure, kneading it for an extra 5 minutes is always an option :) while it is possible to overwork dough to the point of breaking the gluten reticule,
it is basically impossible to do so with only hand kneading. Even the most forceful kneader is not able to generate enough sustained intensity to raise
the internal temperature too much.

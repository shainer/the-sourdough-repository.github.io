## Introduction to my sourdough starter

This page presents some basic information about my sourdough starter. If you already have your own starter, it should help you navigate my recipes and make sure
you can use them appropriately. If you do not, it will give you some basic ideas on

### Hydration

When I first received my starter, I decided for some reason to feed it with a 70-80% hydration percentage. I know now that this is
quite an uncommon proportion: most people either keep a _stiff_ starter at 40-50% hydration, or a _liquid_ starter at 100% hydration. As a result, mine is
somewhere in between those two. Regardless, I've been able to use most sourdough recipes on the Web with negligible changes, as the difference in water
content is very minor.

I have read in a book that a stiffer starter makes for more sour products, as the lack of water favours Lactobacillus, i.e. the bacteria responsible for
giving sourdough products their distinct sour flavour; on the other hand, a more liquid starter favours the yeasts, which do not contribute to the sour
flavour. In order to test it I have tried lowering the hydration percentage for a few refreshes, but I have not noticed any difference in the final result, so I
went back to my usual percentages.

### Feeding

Since I do not bake very often, I keep my starter in a jar in the fridge; once a week, I feed it.

#### Schedule

Refrigerated starter is quite forgiving: I have been able
to delay the feeding for up to 10 days on some occasions with no bad effects. However, a 2 weeks delay is dangerous; I've tried keeping a small piece for
that long once (for science!) and it grew mould, so it went to the bin. If you are away from home for 2 weeks, you can **freeze** it instead. I'll post the
procedure for that in a separate post.

#### Quantities

I normally feed 150 grams of starter with 150 grams of white bread flour and 120 gr (80%) of water. With this quantity, you should be able to make one
large loaf of bread every week, refresh another 150 grams for the following week, and still have about 60-75 grams left just in case you feel about doing
a different experiment or one of those recipes that use leftover starter. And, if I am not planning anything beside bread, I am not discarding too much
so I do not feel guilty.

#### Procedure

When I feed the starter, I usually try to keep it at room temperature for 1 hour before feeding, and 1 hour afterwards. I also use that time to wash the jar
with water. As many recommend, I do not use dish soap as I am worried it will interfere with the yeast activity. This makes the job quite hard; I find that
a sponge scourer works nicely for this and unlike regular dish sponges can be cleaned more easily afterwards. Note that washing the jar is not technically required, but I don't
like having bits of old dried starter stuck all around the jar.
